    <h1>Ableism:</h1>
      <p>
        Ableism is the intentional and unintentional discrimination against people with disabilities.  These disabilities are physical and mental.  This discrimination comes in multiple forms such as institutionalized discrimination or social prejudice.  An example of institutionalized ableism is government buildings that do not provide accessibility to those with mobility problems.  On the other hand, an example of social prejudice is when people use the term “retarded”.  Using this word alienates and offends people with intellectual and developmental disabilities as well as emphasizing negative stereotypes about them.
